A Single Neuron with Sigmoid Activation Function
A neuron with a set of inputs and weights associated with them. Instead of just getting the linear product, you will give it to sigmoid function to get outputs between 0 and 1.

Initializing parameters
Calculating the cost function and its gradient
Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
Gather all three functions above into a main model function.
